# Where's Waldo React App

This is a fun and interactive **Where's Waldo**-style game built with React. Players choose one of their favorite images and try to find three characters: **Luna**, **Milo**, and **Ziggy**.

The app uses a separate backend server ([waldo-server](https://github.com/yourusername/waldo-server)) powered by PostgreSQL to store character positions, player data, and leaderboard records.

## Features

- Select an image and search for **Luna**, **Milo**, and **Ziggy**.
- Click on the characters when you spot them â€” the app checks your guess based on stored coordinates.
- Your completion time is recorded and submitted to the leaderboard.
- View the **leaderboard** to see how you rank among other players.

## Tech Stack

- **React** for the frontend
- **waldo-server** backend for data storage
- **PostgreSQL** for managing player and character data
